# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Profile picker
ctrl-shift-space (or the strip's `⌄` button) SHALL open the new-tab palette, a picker listing every profile with a short description of what it runs. Pressing ctrl-shift-space again while it is open SHALL close it. The list SHALL be filtered by a case-insensitive subsequence match on the typed text. The picker SHALL be operable with:
- up/down (also ctrl-p / ctrl-n) to move;
- enter to open the profile;
- escape or a click outside to dismiss.

Profiles SHALL NOT be listed in the command palette. The `open_profile_picker` action name SHALL keep opening this picker from user keybindings.

#### Scenario: Filter and open
- **WHEN** the user opens the picker, types `tc` and presses enter
- **THEN** a tab opens with the first profile whose name contains `t` then `c`, such as `tmux (classic)`

#### Scenario: Existing keybinding keeps working
- **WHEN** the config binds `ctrl-shift-p` to `open_profile_picker`
- **THEN** ctrl-shift-p opens the new-tab palette instead of the command palette
